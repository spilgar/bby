            First of all, I wouv uuu the moooooooost.
            <br />
            And I love saying it every time. You make saying it feel so easy and
            natural, so I kinda can't abstain :)). Feels like this letter is a
            bit overdue, but hopefully this makes it a little sweeter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Did you know you are still the best thing that's ever happened to
            me? Like by far. And I get so happy so often thinking about it. It's
            really funny how a person could change your life in so many ways and
            to such extent. And how it can feel like this has been your life
            since forever. It's a bit magic, a bit like how I think it works,
            and I believe a bit of how each of us is, and how we are together.
            And I do think it's a lot of us, more and more of each every day, in
            a way that we move together and not on separate lanes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Probablyy it hasn't been the easiest. I am trying to emphasize with
            all the hardships you had to go through because of me, all the bad
            feelings and low moments, all the "opportunities" you had to realize
            how resilient and patient you can be, and how much faith you could
            have in one person. And I want you to know how grateful I am for
            everything you do for me, for every thought, every good intention,
            every second that you love me the way only you could. Because that
            will forever be the best gift anyone has ever given me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I can't really say how much it means to me. I could say that it
            fills me with life, with warmth, hope, joy, that it made me want to
            become better and stronger in a way I know I couldn't have gotten by
            myself. That it made me a better person, more altruist, a better
            listener, more selfless. But these are ways to only describe it;
            they can't truly define what it means to me. Because to me it feels
            like a never ending fountain, like the warmth of the sun in a nice
            spring day, like a song that I keep on repeating, like home. Like
            it's too good to be true, like I could never get enough of it. Like
            I wish it was like this forever.
          </p>
          <p>
            But I do know it's not a given. And never will. It needs work, it
            needs growth. It may require me to face some pretty big challenges,
            or harsh truths or tough fights I've ever faced in my life. It might
            need me to pay big prices, or make sacrifices that I could never get
            back. But I gotta say: so far it was all so worth it. Every fight we
            had, every argument, every critical moment, I never forgot what you
            mean to me. What your love means to me. How much we fought and
            pushed and hurt to make this work. And then no price seems too big.
            I know you gave it your very fair share, and I hope you feel I gave
            mine too. But I will never stop giving. I will never stop fighting.
            I will never stop loving you.
          </p>
          <p>
            You really are the one for me. I know it. I feel it. And I love it.
          </p>
